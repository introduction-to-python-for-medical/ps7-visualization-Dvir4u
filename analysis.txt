The scatter plot shows the relationship between Alcohol (x-axis) and Color Intensity (y-axis):
There appears to be a positive correlation between Alcohol and Color Intensity. As the alcohol content increases, the color intensity of the wine also tends to increase.
The range of Alcohol 11.0 to 14.5.
The range of Color Intensity is 2.0 to 13.0.

There are a few outliers but we can see the general trend that wines with higher alcohol have higher color intensity, this shows that there is probably correlation between color intensity and alcohol.
