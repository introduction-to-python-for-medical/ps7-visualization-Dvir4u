The scatter plot shows the relationship between Alcohol (x-axis) and Color Intensity (y-axis):

The range of Alcohol 11.0 to 14.5.
The range of Color Intensity is 2.0 to 13.0.

There are a few outliers but we can see the general trend that wines with higher alcohol have higher color intensity, this shows that there is probably correlation between color intensity and alcohol.
